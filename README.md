## Description

This project is a stopwatch. It has **_“start, pause, stop, reset”_** buttons. There is the last time that we measured and the **_“archive”_** button which shows the history of our records. The “stop” button deletes all of the history.
I used _JS_, _CSS_ and _HTML_ for this project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wikaobl/stoper

cd stoper
npm install
```

Run the project

### Good luck! 🐸

After successfully starting the project, open your web browser and go to the specifiedg URL http://localhost:3000
