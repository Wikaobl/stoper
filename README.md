## Description

This project is a stopwatch. It has **_“start, pause, stop, reset”_** buttons. There is the last time that we measured and the **_“archive”-** button which shows the history of our records. The “stop” button deletes all of the history.
I used _JS_, _CSS_ and _HTML_ for this project.
